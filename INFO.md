# What in the world are these exe files?

# These files are called "GDI Malware". GDI malware are programs that display effects to the user. This is one of them.

# What is the icon?

# The icon is the Tanana Sisters but sick. (omg sickdows why did you include grojband into a malware!!1111!!!11) I thought the icon was funny so i included it as the icon (Both for 1.0 and 2.0, But 2XMM has a modded version of the icon)
# Link if you wanna explore the link: https://grojband.fandom.com/wiki/Stomach_Flu_Party

# What are the differences from 2XMM 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0?
# They all have new GDI effects. Thats it.


# Will there be new versions after 3.0?
# No. 3.0 is the final version of 2XMM.
















Have a nice day!
